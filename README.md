# TradingAI

Prototype workspace for an options-trading signal generator powered by Python.

## Getting Started
1. Create and activate a Python 3.11+ virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies (to be defined as the project evolves).
3. Review `projectdescription.md` for the roadmap and architecture decisions.

## Next Steps
- Select market data provider and broker integration (Polygon.io + Tradier suggested).
- Define target tickers, trading cadence, and risk constraints.
- Scaffold data ingestion, modeling, and backtesting modules.

## License
TBD.
